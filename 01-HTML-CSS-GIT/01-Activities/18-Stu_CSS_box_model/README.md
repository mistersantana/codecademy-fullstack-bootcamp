# Box Model Practice (4 Boxes)

## Objective
Set padding, border, and margin on four boxes.

## Tasks
1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. Style each `.box` with padding, border, and margin so they are clearly separated.
3. Keep values readable and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Four boxes show visible padding, border, and margin.

## Tips
Borders make padding/margin easier to see.
