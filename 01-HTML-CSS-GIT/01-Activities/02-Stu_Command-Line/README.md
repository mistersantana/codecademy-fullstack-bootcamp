# Command Line Practice

## Objective
Practice basic navigation and file commands (ls, cd, cd .., pwd, mkdir, touch).

## Tasks
1. Open your terminal (Git Bash on Windows; Terminal on macOS).
2. Create a folder named `week1_cli` and `cd` into it.
3. Inside the folder, create two files: `notes.txt` and `todo.txt`.
4. List the contents with `ls` and confirm the files exist.
5. Use `pwd` to print the full path of your current directory.
6. Move up one directory with `cd ..` and confirm using `pwd`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Folder `week1_cli` exists.
- `notes.txt` and `todo.txt` created.
- A short log of commands used is recorded in `Unsolved/commands.txt`.

## Tips
- `ls -la` shows hidden files and details.
- If a command fails, read the error and try again step by step.
