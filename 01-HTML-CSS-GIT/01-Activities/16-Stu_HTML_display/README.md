# Investigate Hidden Element (display)

## Objective
Learn how display affects visibility (inline, block, none).

## Tasks
1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` in the browser.
2. One element is hidden. Find it in `styles.css` and explain why in a comment.
3. Make it visible by changing `display` to `block`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Hidden element is made visible and a comment explains why it was hidden.

## Tips
`display: none` removes the element from layout.
