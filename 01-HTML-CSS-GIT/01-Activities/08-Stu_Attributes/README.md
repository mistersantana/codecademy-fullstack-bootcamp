# Add an Image and Link (Attributes)

## Objective
Use `src` for images and `href`/`rel` for links. Keep assets organized in folders.

## Tasks
1. In `Unsolved/`, open `index.html` and add:
   - An image: `assets/images/profile.jpg` (we've included a placeholder).
   - A link to your GitHub profile using `<a href="...">` and `rel="noopener"`.
2. Ensure the file path is correct (relative path).
3. Link the stylesheet located at `css/styles.css`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Page displays the image from `assets/images/`.
- A working link to your GitHub profile is present.
- Stylesheet is linked using a relative path.

## Tips
Check your folders: `assets/images/` and `css/`.
