# Move Boxes with Positioning

## Objective
Use relative and absolute positioning to nudge boxes.

## Tasks
1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. Use `position: relative` on `.one` and shift it 10px down and right.
3. Use `position: absolute` on `.two` and place it 10px from the bottom-right.
4. Keep `.container` as a positioned context (`position: relative`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- `.one` is offset by ~10px from the top-left.
- `.two` sits in the bottom-right corner of the container.

## Tips
Absolute elements position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
