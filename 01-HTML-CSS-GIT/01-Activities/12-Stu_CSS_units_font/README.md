# Style Text with Font Sizes

## Objective
Use basic font-size and color properties with plain selectors.

## Tasks
1. Open `Unsolved/index.html` and `styles.css`.
2. Set `h1` to 26px, `p` to 16px, and `small` to 13px.
3. Give `h1` a dark color and `small` a lighter color.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The three text elements render in the specified sizes and colors.

## Tips
Stick with `px` for now; we'll explore other units later.
